EXPLANATION:

1. Sort the array in ascending order:
```java
Arrays.sort(arr);
```
The first step of the code is to sort the input array `arr` in ascending order. This sorting operation arranges the tower heights from the shortest to the tallest, making it easier to calculate the minimum and maximum possible heights.

2. Initialize variables `min`, `max`, and `ans`:
```java
int min = arr[0];
int max = arr[n - 1];
int ans = max - min;
```
Here, `min` is set to the height of the shortest tower (the first element of the sorted array `arr[0]`). `max` is set to the height of the tallest tower (the last element of the sorted array `arr[n - 1]`). `ans` is initialized to the maximum possible height difference between the tallest and shortest towers in the array.

3. Iterate through the sorted array and calculate the minimum and maximum possible heights for each tower:
```java
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] - k < 0) {
        continue;
    }
    min = Math.min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k);
    max = Math.max(arr[i - 1] + k, arr[n - 1] - k);
    ans = Math.min(ans, max - min);
}
```
The loop starts from index `1` because we have already considered the first element as the minimum height (`min = arr[0]`) outside the loop.

- Inside the loop, we first check if the current tower's height minus `k` is less than zero. If it is, it means reducing `k` from the current height would result in a negative value, which is not valid for the problem's context. In such cases, we skip the current iteration using `continue`.

- If the current tower's height minus `k` is greater than or equal to zero (`arr[i] - k >= 0`), we proceed to calculate the minimum and maximum possible heights for the current tower.

- `min`: The minimum possible height for the current tower is calculated as the smaller value between `arr[0] + k` (the minimum possible height achieved by increasing the height of the shortest tower by `k`) and `arr[i] - k` (the minimum possible height achieved by reducing the height of the current tower by `k`).

- `max`: The maximum possible height for the current tower is calculated as the larger value between `arr[i - 1] + k` (the maximum possible height achieved by increasing the height of the previous tower by `k`) and `arr[n - 1] - k` (the maximum possible height achieved by reducing the height of the tallest tower by `k`).

- The `ans` is updated with the minimum value between the previously calculated `ans` and the difference between the maximum and minimum possible heights for the current tower. This ensures that `ans` stores the smallest height difference among all the towers processed so far.

4. Return the final answer `ans`:
```java
return ans;
```
Finally, the function returns the minimum possible height difference (`ans`) between the tallest and shortest towers after adjusting the heights by at most `k`.

The overall purpose of this function is to find the minimum height difference that can be achieved by adjusting the heights of the towers within the array by at most `k`. It does so by iterating through the sorted array and calculating the minimum and maximum possible heights for each tower while updating the answer (`ans`) with the smallest height difference found so far.
